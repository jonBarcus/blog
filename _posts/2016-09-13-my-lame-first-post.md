Okay, so, here's my first post on here.  It's going to be devoid of any value to anyone but me.  Please, forgive me.  Also, forgive me for using "Hello, World!" as my title...it's a coding thing.

So, here's my first post and I'm going to just get this up there.

I'm going to the Red Sox game tonight.  Playing the Orioles.  Quite looking forward to it, as it should be a good game, not short of significance in the Playoff race as well as getting closer and closer to Big Papi's retirement.  On his retirement I'll say this:  I'm happy.  He gave us an amazing final season and I'm grateful that this is how he gets to be remembered.  I'd love nothing more than for him to go out with a fourth World Series ring, but in lieu of that, seeing him play as if he was in the prime of his career has been nothing short of special.

Otherwise, it's good to be back in Boston (having de jure moved back April of this year, my de facto move was in January).

Well, that's all I'm going to write for now.  I'll get back to work on this later.
